# Comp-Vision-Projects
This is a compilation of computer vision projects I did in college.
Most of these are experimentations of using different filters to images such as gaussian filter, mean, filter, sobel filter, and laplacian filter. 
I have one project about using a face detection algorithm such as haar cascade and MTCNN. 
All of these projects includes experimenting and combination of different parameters to achieve a high accuracy and good output.
