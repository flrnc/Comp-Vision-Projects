# Comp-Vision-Projects
A compilation of computer vision projects I developed during my college years, exploring various techniques and algorithms in computer vision.

##Overview
This repository shows various experiments and projects to enhance image processing and facial detection. These projects demonstrate my ability to explore, implement, and fine-tune multiple computer vision techniques for accuracy and efficiency.

##Key Features:
### **Image Filtering Techniques** 
Experimented with applying different filters such as:
- Gaussian Filter
- Mean Filter
- Sobel Filter
- Laplacian Filter

### **Face Detection Algorithms**
Implemented and compared **Haar Cascade** and **MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)** for face detection.

### **Parameter Tuning:**
Fine-tuned combinations of parameters to achieve high accuracy and optimal results for different tasks.
